nocontent -- because there's nothing in there
---------

This tool let you find files with no content, which by current definition are
files with no non-zero bytes (i.e. full of zeros or empty files).

You need Go environment set up in order to install this tool.
Check https://golang.org/doc/install for details.

Install:
	$ go get github.com/tg/nocontent
	
Run:
	$ nocontent path

See:
	 0    path/emptyfile
	10    path/tenzeros
	
Story? I've done this because after restoring data from my (time machine)
backup some of the files were broken. After closer look it turned out they
were filled with zeros. I said: what?; and had to hunt them all.
